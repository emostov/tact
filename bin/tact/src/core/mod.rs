    "stronger model or `xhigh`/`max` upfront can be cheaper and faster than repeated weaker runs; ",
    "do not require a cheaper or lower-effort attempt first. Name `luna`, `sol`, or `astra` ",
    "explicitly. Consider Luna for simple tasks, Sol for bounded coding and analysis, and Astra ",
    "for the hardest reasoning. The current turn's ",
    "model and effort are supplied in `<agent_context>`. A child's model cannot exceed the ",
    "spawning parent's model (`luna` < `sol` < `astra`). Root agents use the live ",

    "their own assigned effort, regardless of the root's cap. Existing children retain their ",
    "model and effort.\n\n",
    "Choose effort for the full delegated reasoning obligation:\n\n",
    "- `low`: bounded lookups, extraction, mechanical edits, or prescribed checks.\n",
    "- `medium`: localized implementation, editorial/design work, or focused review with an ",
    "established contract.\n",
    "- `high`: a difficult but bounded investigation or correctness proof with identifiable ",
    "invariant owners and failure cases; for example, tracing a cancellation bug through pending ",
    "I/O completion and successor reopen.\n",
    "- `xhigh`: derive a missing contract, reconcile interacting owners, or compare designs whose ",

    "where a durability barrier belongs while accounting for crash safety and namespace-lock ",
    "contention. Also consider it when a completed `high` result misses the same invariant.\n",
    "- `max`: own the hardest integrated architecture or correctness problem, where several ",
    "coupled invariants must be solved together and locally passing components can hide a composed ",
    "failure. Examples include proving runtime-to-journal durability through pruning, publication, ",
    "and repeated crashes, or redesigning a protocol across authentication, proof retention, ",
    "recovery, and replay. Assign the complete proof and attempts to falsify it to this agent.\n\n",
    "Choose `xhigh` or `max` immediately when those challenges are apparent. Do not scatter a ",
    "global proof across repeated weaker local reviews. A review label, file count, difficult ",
    "parent project, or changed user requirements alone does not justify high effort for every ",
    "child. For `high` or above, identify the concrete reasoning challenge in the task brief. ",
    "Higher effort still requires causal tests and evidence.\n\n",
    "If a completed answer is unsatisfactory, supply missing context or request a focused follow-up ",
